Welcome to our Github for our COMP2911 project which is to build a game like Sokoban.

The purpose of this project is to create a real game by Java and let us understand how to design using basic UI knowledge,
gernerate maps by algrithms such as A star, Breath First Search and Depth-First Search. 

The repository will be public at least the end of this Course since the requirement of University and if anyone of who contributed this project need this to show up at their resume, I will set this project be public.
